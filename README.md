# MLGEO2024_LiangtongW
#### *For course ESS 469 in UW, autunm 2024, by Liangtong(Sry) Wei:*

I'm interested in Oceanography-related topics such as sea-air interaction, heat flux interchange on different sea levels, mechanisms of extreme climates that are related to ocean current/ heat/ eddies, etc. 

For now, I'm specifically interested in reproducing the result in 
Giamalaki, K., Beaulieu, C., & Prochaska, J. X. (2022). Assessing Predictability of Marine Heatwaves With Random Forests. Geophysical Research Letters, 49(23), e2022GL099069. https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL099069

**It is open access with data and code.**
